# Maze-Solver

In this assignment, you are going to write a program that help Leon find his way in the maze. First, you read the number of rows in the maze and then the rows, each row in one line.


In the array above, character ‘#’ shows a blocked cell and character ‘p’ shows an empty path. The top and bottom row of this maze are all blocked. There is only one ‘p’ on the left side of the maze, which is the entrance of the maze, and there is only one ‘p’ on the right side of the maze, which is the exit of the maze. Your task is to help Leon pass through the maze by showing him just one path. Your program should print the path as shown below.
